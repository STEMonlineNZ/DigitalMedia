	<h2>I can’t smell anything – I lost my sense of smell years ago. But I can tell you it’s not the rubbish bins. I empty them every two day – recycling, rubbish, food scraps – all of it. Although they’ve been quite full lately so I’ve been emptying them daily. I have to go – I need to pick up some sawdust for the compost, we ran out last week.</h2>
