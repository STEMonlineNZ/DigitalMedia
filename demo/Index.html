<h1>Mystery smell being investigated</h1>

<h2>Students with asthma advised to stay home</h2>
<p>As you may know, we have been experiencing some unpleasant smells at the school. This has recently worsened and we would like to <i>advise students who suffer from asthmas to remain at home until this has been resolved.</i> We have environmental inspectors coming to investigate but would also welcome any help from the community to identify the source of the smell.<br><br>

It started approximately two weeks ago and worsened significantly last week. While originally the smell was sulphorous similar to rotten eggs, it has recently become more like sewage with a strong ammonia component. This has aggravated some of our students with asthma and so we ask that they remain at home until this has been resolved.<br><br>

We appreciate your patience in this matter.<br><br>
