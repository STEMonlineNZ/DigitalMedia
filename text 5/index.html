	<h2>That smell has been a real issue. I think it’s putting the kids off their food because they haven’t been eating anything we make in class. We have been practising a new healthy menu:<br><br>
Ginger tofu – stir-fried tofu and cabbage with my secret sauce, vegetarian pizza – thick pizza base with spinach, cauliflower and mushrooms, Greek yoghurt –  fermented in class using goat’s milk with no extra sugar, brussel pie – brussel sprouts in a flaked puff pastry.
